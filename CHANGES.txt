# These are the files which are/were not included in the original Noto Emoji.
# Due to the fact that I didn't worked with git in mind, ALL emojis have been
# reuploaded.
# There are currently four types of changes:
#   new:  Completely new emojis which do not have to do anything with the
#             original Noto Emoji project
#   new*: New emojis based on the assets provided by Noto Emoji
#   alt:  Emojis which I updated because I either didn't like their look or
#         because they weren't compatible to other emoji fonts
#   goo:  Although I'm not a fan of the current Noto Emoji style, I didn't want
#         To have black squares for new emojis I didn't implement yet. 
#         So I decided to write a small script (which is so bad that I don't
#         want to publish it here) which replaces the two color gradients with
#         a one color gradient (so basically a solid color).
#         At the end these are the emojis copied from the new version of 
#         Noto-Emoji.
#   ?:    My file browser says I altered the file but there is no (visible)
#         difference
#
#   pattern:
#       <UNICODE SEQUENCE>: <TYPE> [(COMMENT)]
#
#   '<UNICODE SEQUENCE>*' means that all variations have been altered/added
#   '<UNICODE SEQUENCE>-<UNICODE SEQUENCE>' means a range of emojis
#
#   The names are currently not in order
